# shapeminer-qgis-plugin
Plugin useful to collect data for French territory only. Starting with a INSEE code input, this plugin retrieves all the GIS data available for the corresponding commune. Once reached, the data is saved into shapefiles following a redundant file system and added to the project with corresponding styles.
